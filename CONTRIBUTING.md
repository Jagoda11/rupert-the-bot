## 📝 Submitting a pull request

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Make sure the tests pass on your machine: `npm test`. Note: these tests also apply the linter, so there's no need to lint separately.
4. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
5. Make your change, add tests, and ensure the tests still pass.
6. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].
7. Give yourself a pat on the back 👏 and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Write and update tests.
- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you'd like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Write a [good commit message](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocking you.
